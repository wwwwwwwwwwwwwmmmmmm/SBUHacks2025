# 🎧 CLP — Call Listener Portal
### AI-Powered Insights from Every Customer Conversation

---

## 💡 The Problem
Customer service teams handle **countless calls and chats every day**, but **managers rarely have time to analyze them all**.  
They often ask:  
- What are customers most frustrated about?  
- What do they consistently praise?  
- Are there trends we’re missing?  

Currently, the answers hide inside hours of raw transcripts — **unstructured, unread, and untapped**.  
Manual review is slow, and simple keyword analytics miss nuance.

## ⚙️ The Solution

**CLP (Call Listener Portal)** is a **B2B SaaS platform** that transforms customer service transcripts into **actionable
insights** powered by **NeuralSeek AI**.

Our system automatically:  
1. **Ingests call transcripts** and stores them in both a **SQL database** and a **NeuralSeek knowledge base**.  
2. **Summarizes** each call, extracting **positive** and **negative feedback**.  
3. Displays interactive **word clouds** of the most common positive and negative themes.  
4. Lets managers **click any word** to instantly view the transcripts and summaries where it appeared.  

And that’s not all — managers can **chat directly with CLP’s AI assistant** to explore trends conversationally:

- “What were the top complaints this week?”  
- “Show me positive mentions about communication.”  
- “Summarize issues related to billing in the past 7 days.”  

This enables a true **back-and-forth discovery experience** — turning every transcript into insight.

## 🧠 How It Works
- **Frontend (Next.js + React):** Upload portal, analytics dashboard, and AI chat interface.  
- **Backend (Node.js + Postgres):** Transcript storage, search, and API integration.  
- **AI Layer (NeuralSeek + Watson Discovery):** Knowledge base ingestion, summarization, and conversational querying.  
- **Visualization:** Interactive word clouds powered by D3.js / React Word Cloud.

Traditional analytics can’t interpret tone, context, or emotion.  
By integrating NeuralSeek’s AI capabilities, CLP can:

- **Understand customer sentiment** beyond keywords.  
- **Summarize calls** automatically with natural language understanding.  
- **Enable direct chat-based exploration** across all transcripts.  

It’s not just data — it’s **conversational business intelligence**.
